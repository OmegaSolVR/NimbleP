Description

Buttman is a masked figure who appears whenever something has already gone wrong. He is not particularly skilled, stealthy, or intimidating, but he is extremely committed. Buttman believes deeply that he is a hero, despite mounting evidence that his presence mainly escalates situations.

He wears a dramatic costume, strikes powerful poses, and announces himself loudly, usually moments before tripping over something important. Villains fear him not because he is dangerous, but because nobody knows what he will do next, including Buttman.
