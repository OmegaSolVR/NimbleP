Description

Nimblegrimp is a small, loud, and energetically confident individual who has survived far more danger than expected, mostly by talking fast and moving faster. Formerly a low-ranking assistant to someone much more important, he learned early that sounding certain is often more effective than being correct.

Through a long chain of misunderstandings, Nimblegrimp is now regarded as “remarkably capable.” He has never corrected this assumption. He travels widely, offering advice, pulling levers he absolutely should not touch, and declaring that unfolding disasters are “under control” while actively running from them.
