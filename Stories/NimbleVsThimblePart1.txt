Nimblegrimp and ThimblePimp lay in the hay cart, staring up at the calm, innocent sky.

“See?” Nimblegrimp said proudly. “Nothing permanently bad happened.”

ThimblePimp nodded. “Statistically, that tracks.”

They climbed out of the cart.

Nimblegrimp landed on his feet and dusted himself off. “Alright, let’s move before—”

ThimblePimp stood.

The moment his weight hit the ground, his leg snapped with a loud, unmistakable CRACK.

ThimblePimp screamed.

He collapsed instantly, unable to stand, unable to put any weight on it.

Nimblegrimp spun around. “WHAT WAS THAT.”

ThimblePimp clutched his leg, pale and shaking. “Okay. Okay. That is broken. That is fully broken. I cannot walk.”

A nearby bystander gasped. “His leg’s broken!”

A second bystander nodded gravely. “Yes. Very broken.”

ThimblePimp tried to move and immediately cried out again, shaking his head. “Nope. Can’t stand. Can’t walk. Leg does not function.”

Nimblegrimp knelt beside him, horrified. “So… next episode?”

ThimblePimp forced a weak grin. “Next episode.”

The camera pulled back as Nimblegrimp tried to lift him and failed completely.

ThimblePimp lay there, leg broken, unable to walk, stuck in the hay.

FREEZE FRAME.

END OF EPISODE.
